    <p>On Friday, November 7th, Congressman Darrell Issa took to Fox news and called United States CTO Todd Park a &ldquo;paid liar&rdquo;. On the evening of November 8th, Todd Park was subpoenaed by the congressman to testify instead of continuing to fix Healthcare.gov. Over the course of his federal career, CTO Park has done more to improve the health of America's government than most ever dream of. He's created the successful Presidential Innovation Fellowship program, launched dozens of open data initiatives across government and tirelessly worked to make the United States Federal Government more innovative and citizen centric.</p>
    <p>People make mistakes. We hope that Chairman Issa realizes his mistake, and that he can reach across the aisle and instead of looking for who to blame for Healthcare.gov, look towards solving the systems and processes that enabled it, if, anything, by working hard with the United States Senate for passage of his own bill, the <a href='http://legislation.nextgov.com/' target='_blank'>Federal IT Reform Act</a>.</p>
